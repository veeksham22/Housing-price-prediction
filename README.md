# Bangalore Housing Price Predictor

This project is a **Bangalore Housing Price Predictor** that leverages machine learning models and ensemble learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. It includes a React-based frontend styled with Tailwind CSS and a Flask-based backend connected to machine learning models built with Scikit-learn. 

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models Used**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Lasso Regression
- **Ensemble Learning**: The best prediction among the models is selected as the final output.
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Backend**: Flask REST API for handling predictions and connecting the frontend with the ML models.
- **Dataset**: Bangalore housing price dataset with features like location, size, square footage, etc.
